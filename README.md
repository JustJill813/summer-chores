# summer-chores
These are the Exercise Instructions:

Someone has a list of summer chores they have to do every Saturday. There are a lot of chores for them to do and naturally get more tired throughout completing their tasks. If they get too tired, they may have to take a break and go to sleep before completing their chores.

They have a strict routine, which follows in order:

Mowing the yard
Weedeating the edges of the house and fence line
Trimming the hedges
Collect fallen wood for summer night fires
Water the garden
If they manage not to get tired and fall asleep while doing their chores, they have successfully completed their chores. Also, there's never a chance of the person falling asleep before mowing the yard.



Here is my explanation of how I wrote my code:

1. Each chore function will simulate an arbitrary completion time - setTimeout()
2. The persons gets increasingly tired and each task has a chance of failure - Math.random()
3. All the functions are nested and this forms the callback sequence.
4. If the person falls asleep the chores stop.


To run the code:
Open Visual Studio
Make sure the profile of the open terminal is set to powershell
In the terminal of VSC TYPE: node callbackVersion.js
